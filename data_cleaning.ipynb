We designed a workstation to assist clinicians to automatically implement the accurate analysis of RT MCE. The workstation can compute some hemodynamic parameters of myocardial microcirculation, e.g., myocardial blood flow, myocardial blood flow mean velocity, and myocardial blood volume. Our new methods involved in the quantitative analysis of RT MCE are summarized as follows. 1) A novel orthogonal array optimization (OAO) technique was proposed and used to estimate the unknown parameters of the nonlinear model to guarantee numerical stability. 2) Brox's coarse-to-fine warping optical flow technique was employed to automatically track the region of interest located inside the myocardial area to ensure the accuracy of the quantitative analysis. Finally, we illustrate some examples of clinical studies to indicate the effectiveness of the system and the reliability of the methods.\n",
      "Example 2: BACKGROUND:Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent a heterogeneous set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social domain, where the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role. Several researchers have studied the ANS in ASD, during specific cognitive or sensory stimuli while few studies have examined response during social interactions. Wearable technologies can be very helpful in monitoring autonomic response in children with ASD in semi-naturalistic setting. The novelty of this study is to use such technologies to acquire physiological signals during therapeutic sessions supported by interactive \"serious games\" and to correlate the ANS response to the engagement of the child during sociocognitive tasks for an evaluation of the treatment effect and for the personalization of the therapy.METHOD:A wearable chest belt for electrocardiographic (ECG) signal recording was used and specific algorithms for the extraction of clinically relevant features (Heart Rate - HR, Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences - RMSSD and Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia - RSA) were developed. Sociocognitive tasks were mediated by \"serious games\" implemented on two tablets, which allowed a precise coding of the behaviors of the children. A longitudinal assessment of the physiological response of the children during six months of treatment was performed.RESULTS:A link between physiological response, i.e. decrease in RMSSD and RSA, and engagement of the children during sociocognitive tasks was found. Longitudinal changes in the children's autonomic response, including a decrease of RSA during the engagement throughout the therapeutic sessions, were found.CONCLUSIONS:These results foster the feasibility of this methodology to be applied in a clinical setting for the monitoring of the ANS response of children with ASD during treatment. A larger sample of patients is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.\n",
      "Example 3: On-line full body imitation with a humanoid robot standing on its own two feet requires simultaneously maintaining the balance and imitating the motion of the demonstrator. In this paper we present a method that allows real-time motion imitation while maintaining stability, based on prioritized task control. We also describe a method of modified prioritized kinematic control that constrains the imitated motion to preserve stability only when the robot would tip over, but does not alter the motions otherwise. To cope with the passive compliance of the robot, we show how to model the estimation of the center of mass of the robot using support vector machines. In the paper we give detailed description of all steps of the algorithm, essentially providing a tutorial on the implementation of kinematic stability control. We present the results on a child-sized humanoid robot called Compliant Humanoid Platform or COMAN. Our implementation shows reactive and stable on-line motion imitation of the humanoid robot.\n",

In particular we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the hybrid regulation problem, which non-trivially extend the classical conditions of regulation for LTI non-hybrid systems. Interestingly, differently from the latter, the former conditions are intrinsically nonlinear, since the dynamics of the interconnected system restricted to the error-zeroing invariant subspace may not be limited, as in the non-hybrid case, to those of the exosystem E. Then, we explore the relation between the discussed necessary and sufficient conditions and the constructive approach provided by the subspace invariant algorithm.\n",
      "Example 2: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now an important and pressing matter. Systems control theory, and in particular feedback control, can contribute to the design of policies that achieve sustainable levels of emissions of CO 2  (and other greenhouse gases) while minimizing the impact on the economy, and at the same time explicitly addressing the high levels of uncertainty associated with predictions of future emissions. In this paper, preliminary results are described for an approach where economic Model Predictive Control (MPC) is applied to a Regional dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE model) as a test bed to design savings rates and global carbon tax for greenhouse gas emissions. Using feedback control, the policies are updated on the basis of the observed emissions, rather than on the predicted level of emissions. The basic structure and principle of the RICE model is firstly introduced and some key equations are described. The idea of introducing feedback control is then explained and economic MPC is applied to design policies for CO 2  emissions. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for two different scenarios. Feedback control design provides a degree of robustness against disturbances and model uncertainties, which is illustrated through a simulation study with two particular types of uncertainties. The results obtained in this paper illustrate the strength of the proposed design approach and form the basis for future research on using systems control theory to design optimal sustainable policies.\n",
      "Example 3: This paper focuses on the problem of adaptive neural output-feedback control for a class of nonstrict-feedback nonlinear systems where the system coefficient functions are unknown. First, the original system is transformed into a new defined system by a linear state transformation. Then, by using the dynamic surface control (DSC) technique, an improved input-driven filter is proposed. Based on this filter and the approximation property of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, an adaptive neural output-feedback controller is designed via backstepping technique, which can guarantee that all the signals in the closed-loop system are ultimately bounded. The main contribution of this paper lies in that a simpler and more effective design procedure of adaptive neural output-feedback tracking controller is proposed for the underlying system which is more general than some existing ones in literature. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new design algorithm.\n",

      "Example 1: Reservoir modeling is an on-going activity during the production life of a reservoir. One challenge to constructing accurate reservoir models is the time required to carry out a large number of computer simulations. To address this issue, we have constructed surrogate models (proxies) for the computer simulator to reduce the simulation time. The quality of the proxies, however, relies on the quality of the computer simulation data. Frequently, the majority of the simulation outputs match poorly to the production data collected from the field. In other words, most of the data describe the characteristics of what the reservoir is not (negative samples), rather than what the reservoir is (positive samples). Applying machine learning methods to train a simulator proxy based on these data faces the challenge of imbalanced training data. This work applies active learning support vector machines to incrementally select a subset of informative simulation data to train a classifier as the simulator proxy. We compare the results with the results produced by the standard support vector machines combined with other imbalanced training data handling techniques. Based on the support vectors in the trained classifiers, we analyze high impact parameters that separating good-matching reservoir models from bad-matching models.\n",
      "Example 2: Stable and high distinctive image features are the basis for web near-duplicate image detection. SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) not only has good scale and brightness invariance, also has a certain robustness to affine distortion, perspective change, and additive noise. However, to extract SIFT features to represent an image, hundreds or even thousands of SIFT key points need to be selected. And each key point needs to be described by using a 128-dimensional feature vector. Thus, the matching cost of detection method based on SIFT features is high. In this paper, we propose to apply the singular value decomposition (SVD) method for feature matching and extract the new features from the set of SIFT feature points. The extracted feature is termed as SVD-SIFT. Experimental results demonstrate that the method can obtain a better tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency for detection.\n",

The use of motion compensation by regularized optical flow methods permits robust patch comparison in a spatiotemporal volume. The use of principal component analysis ensures the correct preservation of fine texture and details.

The main benefit of the approach relates to traceability between goal models and business process models. The approach is exemplified with a case study in a healthcare organisation. We have observed that establishing the relations between goal and business process models is far from straightforward. This can be accounted by the fact that goals may be formulated in various levels of abstraction and precision and further, that goals may refer to various aspects of an organisation and its processes. Our approach for alignment is based on harmonising goal models such that they can be subsequently aligned with business process models. We propose a goal taxonomy to harmonise the goal domain and report on the implications of this classification in establishing the relationships with business processes.\n",

      "Example 2: An analog circuit for implementing pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs) in very-large-scale integration (VLSI) hardware has been developed using the Neuron-MOS (νMOS) technology. PCNNs are biologically inspired models having powerful ability for image feature generation. With the νMOS technology, weighted sum of multiple input signals, which is an essential of PCNNs, is implemented simply by the capacitive coupling effect in a νMOS block. By employing the switched floating gates in the νMOS blocks as temporary analog memories, the storage of image data is simply realized. Moreover, the function of decay generation, which is crucial for emulating PCNNs neuronal dynamics, is also merged into a νMOS block by utilizing the input-terminal capacitors in it. With such techniques, the circuit achieves a purely voltage-mode implementation of PCNNs in a compact structure. Inheriting the merits of PCNNs, the circuit has good discriminability against different patterns as well as robustness against rotation and translation of identical patterns, which is analogous to human image perception. The performance of the circuit has been verified by the measurements of a proof-of-concept chip fabricated in a 0.35- μm double-polysilicon CMOS technology.\n",

      "Example 1: Consider an MISO channel overheard by multiple eavesdroppers. Our goal is to design an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit strategy, such that the achievable secrecy rate is maximized subject to the sum power constraint. AN-aided secure transmission has recently been found to be a promising approach for blocking eavesdropping attempts. In many existing studies, the confidential information transmit covariance and the AN covariance are not simultaneously optimized. In particular, for design convenience, it is common to prefix the AN covariance as a specific kind of spatially isotropic covariance. This paper considers joint optimization of the transmit and AN covariances for secrecy rate maximization (SRM), with a design flexibility that the AN can take any spatial pattern. Hence, the proposed design has potential in jamming the eavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the channel state information (CSI). We derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through both analysis and convex conic optimization machinery. We show that the SRM problem can be recast as a single-variable optimization problem, and that resultant problem can be efficiently handled by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Our framework deals with a general setup of multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers, and can cater for additional constraints arising from specific application scenarios, such as interference temperature constraints in interference networks. We also generalize the framework to an imperfect CSI case where a worst-case robust SRM formulation is considered. A suboptimal but safe solution to the outage-constrained robust SRM design is also investigated. Simulation results show that the proposed AN-aided SRM design yields significant secrecy rate gains over an optimal no-AN design and the isotropic AN design, especially when there are more eavesdroppers.\n",
      "Example 2: We consider the Gaussian wiretap channel with M helpers, where no eavesdropper channel state information (CSI) is available at the legitimate entities. The exact secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with M helpers with perfect CSI at the transmitters was found in [1], [2] to be M/M+1. One of the key ingredients of the optimal achievable scheme in [1], [2] is to align cooperative jamming signals with the information symbols at the eavesdropper to limit the information leakage rate. This required perfect eavesdropper CSI at the transmitters. Motivated by the recent result in [3], we propose a new achievable scheme in which cooperative jamming signals span the entire space of the eavesdropper, but are not exactly aligned with the information symbols. We show that this scheme achieves the same secure d.o.f. of M/M+1 in [1], [2] but does not require any eavesdropper CSI; the transmitters blindly cooperative jam the eavesdropper.\n",

      "Example 2: Objective: This paper proposes a new methodology that focuses on the effects of cold and harsh environments on the reliability of human performance. Background: As maritime operations move into Arctic and Antarctic environments, decision makers must be able to recognize how cold weather affects human performance and subsequently adjusts management and operational tools and strategies. Method: In the present work, a revised version of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) methodology has been developed to assess the effects of cold on the likelihood of human error in offshore oil and gas facilities. This methodology has been applied to post-maintenance tasks of offshore oil and gas facility pumps to investigate how management, operational, and equipment issues must be considered in risk analysis and prediction of human error in cold environments. Results: This paper provides a proof of concept indicating that the risk associated with operations in cold environments is greater than the risk associated with the same operations performed in temperate climates. It also develops guidelines regarding how this risk can be assessed. The results illustrate that in post-maintenance procedures of a pump, the risk value related to the effect of cold and harsh environments on operator cognitive performance is twice as high as the risk value when performed in normal conditions. Conclusion: The present work demonstrates significant differences between human error probabilities (HEPs) and associated risks in normal conditions as opposed to cold and harsh environments. This study also highlights that the cognitive performance of the human operator is the most important factor affected by the cold and harsh conditions. Application: The methodology developed in this paper can be used for reevaluating the HEPs for particular scenarios that occur in harsh environments since these HEPs may not be comparable to similar scenarios in normal conditions.

To compare the new mechanism with the two traditional approaches, a multiplayer game scenario is simulated.

We note that this scheme has already been shown vulnerable to the off-line password guessing attack by Tapiador et al. We perform a further cryptanalysis on this protocol and observe that it is prone to the clogging attack, a kind of denial of service (DOS) attack. We observe that all smart card based authentication protocols which precede the one by Song, and require the server to compute the computationally intensive modular exponentiation, like the one by Xu et al., or Lee et al., are prone to the clogging attack. Further, some recent protocols by Li, and Wang et al. are also vulnerable to the clogging attack. We then suggest an improvement on the protocol to prevent the clogging attack. The other protocol we consider is a two-party identity-based authenticated key agreement protocol by Holbl et al. They have devised two such protocols in their work. They call them Protocol 1 and Protocol 2. Both the protocols have already been shown vulnerable to the insider attack in a recent work by Chen et al. Here we consider Protocol 2 and show its vulnerability to a simple man-in-the-middle attack where the adversary does not know or calculate either party's private key, or the session key. Protocol 2 by Holbl et al is an improvement over a previous work by Tseng. This makes the Tseng's protocol vulnerable to the attack we illustrate.

Selecting an optimal set of physical structures is computationally hard since it involves searching a vast space of possible configurations. Commercial DBMSs offer tools that can address this problem. The usefulness of such tools, however, is limited by their dependence on greedy heuristics, the need for a-priori (offline) knowledge of the workload, and lack of an optimal materialization schedule to get the best out of suggested design features. Moreover, the open source DBMSs do not provide any automated tuning tools.   This demonstration introduces a comprehensive physical designer for the PostgreSQL open source DBMS. The tool suggests design features for both offline and online workloads. It provides close to optimal suggestions for indexes for a given workload by modeling the problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and solving it by sophisticated and mature solvers. It also determines the interaction between indexes to suggest an effective materialization strategy for the selected indexes.

Then we solve the latter two convolution problems in subquadratic time, which are interesting results in their own right. These results shed some light on the classic sorting X+Y problem, because the convolutions can be viewed as computing order statistics on the antidiagonals of the X+Y matrix.

Second, PSS executes comparison tasks in parallel, each using a hybrid data structure that combines the advantages of forward and inverted indexing.

      "Example 1: Security of embedded devices is a timely and important issue, due to the proliferation of these devices into numerous and diverse settings, as well as their growing popularity as attack targets, especially, via remote malware infestations. One important defense mechanism is  remote attestation , whereby a trusted, and possibly remote, party (verifier) checks the internal state of an untrusted, and potentially compromised, device (prover).   Despite much prior work, remote attestation remains a vibrant research topic. However, most attestation schemes naturally focus on the scenario where the verifier is trusted and the prover is not. The opposite setting---where the prover is benign, and the verifier is malicious---has been side-stepped. To this end, this paper considers the issue of prover security, including: verifier impersonation, denial-of-service (DoS) and replay attacks, all of which result in unauthorized invocation of attestation functionality on the prover. We argue that protection of the prover from these attacks must be treated as an important component of any remote attestation method. We formulate a new  roaming  adversary model for this scenario and present the trade-offs involved in countering this threat. We also identify new features and methods needed to protect the prover with minimal additional requirements.\n",

The well-defined chromosome structure leads brings about more complex morphological operations can be composed in a short sequence. Because of a reasonable evolution strategy, the evolution effectiveness of this algorithm is guaranteed.

      "Example 2: Several different metrics have been proposed for quantifying the throughput of multicore processors. There is no clear consensus about which metric should be used. Some studies even use several throughput metrics. We show that there exists a relation between single-thread average performance metrics and throughput metrics, and that throughput metrics inherit the meaning or lack of meaning of the corresponding single-thread metric. We show that two popular throughput metrics, the weighted speedup and the harmonic mean of speedups, are inconsistent: they do not give equal importance to all benchmarks. Moreover we demonstrate that the weighted speedup favors unfairness. We show that the harmonic mean of IPCs, a seldom used throughput metric, is actually consistent and has a physical meaning. We explain under which conditions the arithmetic mean or the harmonic mean of IPCs can be used as a strong indicator of throughput increase.\n",
      "Example 3: This study examines whether there are some general trends across subject fields regarding the factors affecting the number of citations of articles, focusing especially on those factors that are not directly related to the quality or content of articles (extrinsic factors). For this purpose, from 6 selected subject fields (condensed matter physics, inorganic and nuclear chemistry, electric and electronic engineering, biochemistry and molecular biology, physiology, and gastroenterology), original articles published in the same year were sampled (n = 230–240 for each field). Then, the citation counts received by the articles in relatively long citation windows (6 and 11 years after publication) were predicted by negative binomial multiple regression (NBMR) analysis for each field. Various article features about author collaboration, cited references, visibility, authors' achievements (measured by past publications and citedness), and publishing journals were considered as the explanatory variables of NBMR. Some generality across the fields was found with regard to the selected predicting factors and the degree of significance of these predictors. The Price index was the strongest predictor of citations, and number of references was the next. The effects of number of authors and authors' achievement measures were rather weak.\n",

      "Example 1: We address the problem of recovering a common set of covariates that are relevant simultaneously to several classification problems. By penalizing the sum of ? 2 norms of the blocks of coefficients associated with each covariate across different classification problems, similar sparsity patterns in all models are encouraged. To take computational advantage of the sparsity of solutions at high regularization levels, we propose a blockwise path-following scheme that approximately traces the regularization path. As the regularization coefficient decreases, the algorithm maintains and updates concurrently a growing set of covariates that are simultaneously active for all problems. We also show how to use random projections to extend this approach to the problem of joint subspace selection, where multiple predictors are found in a common low-dimensional subspace. We present theoretical results showing that this random projection approach converges to the solution yielded by trace-norm regularization. Finally, we present a variety of experimental results exploring joint covariate selection and joint subspace selection, comparing the path-following approach to competing algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and running time.\n",
      "Example 2: Krylov subspace iterative solvers are often the method of choice when solving large sparse linear systems. At the same time, hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units continue to offer significant floating point performance gains for matrix and vector computations through easy-to-use libraries of computational kernels. However, as these libraries are usually composed of a well optimized but limited set of linear algebra operations, applications that use them often fail to reduce certain data communications, and hence fail to leverage the full potential of the accelerator. In this paper, we target the acceleration of Krylov subspace iterative methods for graphics processing units, and in particular the Biconjugate Gradient Stabilized solver that significant improvement can be achieved by reformulating the method to reduce data-communications through application-specific kernels instead of using the generic BLAS kernels, e.g. as provided by NVIDIA's cuBLAS library, and by designing a graphics processing unit specific sparse matrix-vector product kernel that is able to more efficiently use the graphics processing unit's computing power. Furthermore, we derive a model estimating the performance improvement, and use experimental data to validate the expected runtime savings. Considering that the derived implementation achieves significantly higher performance, we assert that similar optimizations addressing algorithm structure, as well as sparse matrix-vector, are crucial for the subsequent development of high-performance graphics processing units accelerated Krylov subspace iterative methods.\n",
      "Example 3: In this paper, we design a new iterative low-complexity algorithm for computing the Walsh–Hadamard transform (WHT) of an    $N$    dimensional signal with a    $K$   -sparse WHT. We suppose that    $N$    is a power of two and    $K=O(N^\\alpha)$   , scales sublinearly in    $N$    for some    $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$   . Assuming a random support model for the nonzero transform-domain components, our algorithm reconstructs the WHT of the signal with a sample complexity    $O(K \\log _{2}({N}/{K}))$    and a computational complexity    $O(K\\log _{2}(K) \\log _{2}({N}/{K}))$   . Moreover, the algorithm succeeds with a high probability approaching 1 for large dimension    $N$   . Our approach is mainly based on the subsampling (aliasing) property of the WHT, where by a carefully designed subsampling of the time-domain signal, a suitable aliasing pattern is induced in the transform domain. We treat the resulting aliasing patterns as parity-check constraints and represent them by a bipartite graph. We analyze the properties of the resulting bipartite graphs and borrow ideas from codes defined over sparse bipartite graphs to formulate the recovery of the nonzero spectral values as a peeling decoding algorithm for a specific sparse-graph code transmitted over a binary erasure channel. This enables us to use tools from coding theory (belief-propagation analysis) to characterize the asymptotic performance of our algorithm in the very sparse (   $\\alpha \\in (0, {1}/{3}]$   ) and the less sparse (   $\\alpha \\in ({1}/{3}, 1)$   ) regime. Comprehensive simulation results are provided to assess the empirical performance of the proposed algorithm.\n",

      "Example 1: A Dupin cyclide can be defined, in two different ways, as the envelope of an one-parameter family of oriented spheres. Each family of spheres can be seen as a conic in the space of spheres. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute a characteristic circle of a Dupin cyclide from a point and the tangent at this point in the space of spheres. Then, we propose iterative algorithms (in the space of spheres) to compute (in 3D space) some characteristic circles of a Dupin cyclide which blends two particular canal surfaces. As a singular point of a Dupin cyclide is a point at infinity in the space of spheres, we use the massic points defined by Fiorot. As we subdivide conic arcs, these algorithms are better than the previous algorithms developed by Garnier and Gentil.\n",
      "Example 2: We present a simple and effective algorithm to transfer deformation between surface meshes with multiple components. The algorithm automatically computes spatial relationships between components of the target object, builds correspondences between source and target, and finally transfers deformation of the source onto the target while preserving cohesion between the target's components. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach on various complex models.\n",
      "Example 3: Surgeries of the skull base require accuracy to safely navigate the critical anatomy. This is particularly the case for endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery (ESBS) where the surgeons work within millimeters of neurovascular structures at the skull base. Today's navigation systems provide approximately 2 mm accuracy. Accuracy is limited by the indirect relationship of the navigation system, the image and the patient. We propose a method to directly track the position of the endoscope using video data acquired from the endoscope camera. Our method first tracks image feature points in the video and reconstructs the image feature points to produce 3D points, and then registers the reconstructed point cloud to a surface segmented from preoperative computed tomography (CT) data. After the initial registration, the system tracks image features and maintains the 2D-3D correspondence of image features and 3D locations. These data are then used to update the current camera pose. We present a method for validation of our system, which achieves submillimeter (0.70 mm mean) target registration error (TRE) results.\n",
